## Results

As evidenced in the below image, the least busy times for bikesharing are from 2:00AM - 4:00AM.  These slower times would be ideal for bike repairs and other bike maintenance.

The below image represents the user breakdown by gender.  Blue represents female users, orange represents Male users, and red represents unknown gender.  With a predominantly male user base, marketing efforts should be made to specifically target men.

Most users are spending less than an hour renting the bikes.  As shown below, the majority of trips are under 30 minutes and very few trips last longer than an hour.  This data should be used to strategically place bikes in locations that are close to stores, shops, and other areas of interest.  Bikes are not typically being used for leisure.
